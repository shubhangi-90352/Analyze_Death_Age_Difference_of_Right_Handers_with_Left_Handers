# Analyze_Death_Age_Difference_of_Right_Handers_with_Left_Handers
This notebook embarks on an empirical journey to explore the connection between left-handedness and lifespan. By utilizing age distribution data and statistical techniques, it seeks to uncover insights that refute the claim of reduced longevity for left-handed individuals and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between hand preference and mortality.

In conclusion, our analysis focused on investigating the age at death of left-handed individuals compared to right-handed individuals. By examining data on handedness and death distribution, we gained insights into the relationship between handedness and lifespan.

Our findings revealed that the overall probability of being left-handed among deceased individuals in our study year was approximately 7.8%. This indicates that left-handedness is not a significant factor influencing mortality rates.

Furthermore, we compared the probability of being a specific age at death given left-handedness and right-handedness. Our analysis showed that left-handed individuals had a slightly lower average age at death (approximately 67.2 years) compared to right-handed individuals (approximately 72.8 years). Although there was a noticeable age difference, it was smaller than the 9-year gap reported in previous studies.
